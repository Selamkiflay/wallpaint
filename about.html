  <div class="pr">
  <p> Welcome to our webite, a platform designed by a group of multidisciplinary college students for a school project. We are passionate about simplifying the painting process and providing a user-friendly experience for individuals like you who want to embark on painting activites with confidence.</p>

    <p>As college students with diverse backgrounds and areas of expertise, we came together with a shared vision to create a website that addresses a common challenge: accurately calculating the amount of paint needed for a project. With our combined knowledge and skills in design, technology, and project management, we set out to develop a solution that would revolutionize the way people approach painting</p>


   <h3 style="text-align: center;"> Our Mission:</h3>

<p>
   our mission is to simplify and streamline the process of painting by providing accurate and 
   reliable calculations for the amount of paint needed.
    We believe that painting should be accessible to all, regardless of experience or expertise,
     and our goal is to empower individuals like you to confidently embark on painting projects with ease.</p>
   
   <p>We are committed to saving you time, money, and the frustration that often comes with estimating paint quantities.
    Our mission is to provide you with a user-friendly platform that takes the guesswork out of determining how much paint you need. 
    By utilizing our innovative paint quantity calculator, you can input the dimensions of your space, the number of doors, and windows, and receive a precise estimate of the amount of paint required. 
    This not only eliminates wastage but also ensures that you have enough paint to complete your project without interruptions.</p>
